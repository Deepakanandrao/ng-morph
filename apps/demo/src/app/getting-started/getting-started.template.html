    <strong>ng-morph</strong> is a large set of tools that speeds up your work
    with Angular schematics. It has
    <a tuiLink href="https://ts-morph.com/">ts-morph</a> under the hood and
    allows you to manipulate with safe TypeScript AST.

    <h3>Why is it better than default schematics?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        ðŸ›  There are many tools made for working with Angular. You can easily
        find and manipulate TS and Ng entities.
      </li>

      <li>
        âœ… You work with an abstract tree and it can be replaced, for example,
        with virtual tree for testing instead of real file system. So, you can
        test your schematics rapidly fast.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>How to install</h3>

  <tui-doc-code code="npm i --save-dev ng-morph"></tui-doc-code>

  <p>
    You also need <code>@angular-devkit/core</code> and
    <code>@angular-devkit/schematics</code> to be installed.

  <p>Enjoy!</p>

    <h3>How to use these all things</h3>

    <p>
      Creating Angular <code>ng-add</code> or <code>ng-update</code> schematics
      you work with
      <a
        tuiLink
        href="https://angular.io/guide/schematics-for-libraries#define-the-rule"
        target="_blank"
        >Rule</a
      >
      functions. Rule function gets a <code>Tree</code> as a first argument and
      you can pass this tree to <code>setActiveProject</code> function from
      ng-morph the following way:
    </p>

    <tui-doc-code filename="ng-add.ts" [code]="creatingRule"></tui-doc-code>

    <h3>How to test your schematics</h3>

    <p>
      You can use any test runner you like to check that your schematics work as
      you expect.
    </p>

    <p>Let's try to test the migration above:</p>

    <tui-doc-code
      filename="ng-add.spec.ts"
      [code]="creatingSpec"
    ></tui-doc-code>
